As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as ""conventional"" amphotericin. 2) Liposomal formulations: In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed. From studies, it appears that liposomal amphotericin B preparations exhibit fewer side effects, while having similar efficacy. Various preparations have recently been introduced. All of these are more expensive than plain amphotericin B. AmBisome (LAMB) is a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for injection, developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead Sciences in 1999). It was approved by the FDA in 1997. It is marketed by Gilead in Europe and licensed to Astellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) for marketing in the USA, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in Japan. It consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol that in aqueous media they spontaneously arrange into unilamellar vesicles that contain amphotericin B. Liposomal formulations have been primarily used as it has been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate.

Two molecules of each form a tetramer that aggregate into spiral arms on a disk-like complex. It was approved by the FDA in 1996. Neither of these are true unilamellar liposomes like ambisome. Oral preparations: A major barrier to the use of amphotericin in resource-poor settings is that it must be given intravenously (except for topical applications). An oral preparation exists, but is not commercially available. The amphipathic nature of amphotericin along with its low solubility and permeability has posed major hurdles for oral administration given its low bioavailability.

It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.",

These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics. 2) Newborns: There has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates. 3) Elderly: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity. 4) Additional considerations: People with kidney disease and those on hemodialysis may need the dose adjusted. Cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease. As with other antibiotics, cefazolin may interact with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as probenecid.",
31e3068d-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Chloramphenicol,unrestricted,"1) Use in special populations: Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol glucuronate (which is inactive). In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced. No standard dose reduction exists for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations. The majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate. Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged. Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory. Chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous prodrug form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally. Chloramphenicol passes into breast milk, so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible. 2) Dose monitoring: Plasma levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and patients with abnormal liver function. Plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly, and patients with renal failure. Because efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol are associated with a maximum serum concentration, peak levels (one hour after the intravenous dose is given) should be 10-20 ?g/ml with toxicity > 40 ?g/ml; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be 5-10 ?g/ml.",
31e31d4c-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Cilastatin,unrestricted,"Cilastatin is a chemical compound which inhibits the human enzyme dehydropeptidase. Dehydropeptidase is an enzyme found in the kidney and is responsible for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. Cilastatin can therefore be combined intravenously with imipenem in order to protect it from dehydropeptidase and prolong its antibacterial effect. Imipenem alone is an effective antibiotic and can be given without the cilastatin. Cilastatin itself does not have antibiotic activity although it has been proved to be active against a zinc-dependent beta-lactamase that usually confer antibiotic resistance to certain bacteria; more precisely the carbapenem family of antibiotics. This property is due to the physico-chemical similarities between membrane dipeptidase (MDP), the compound it is usually set to target, and the bacterial metallo-beta-lactamase carried by the CphA gene. Therefore, Cilastatin is considered a beta-lactamase inhibitor, not an antibiotic per se.",
31e32728-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Ciprofloxacin,restricted,"1) Pregnancy: In the United States ciprofloxacin is pregnancy category C. This category includes drugs for which no adequate and well-controlled studies in human pregnancy exist, and for which animal studies have suggested the potential for harm to the fetus, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by the Teratogen Information System concluded therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state no risk exists. Two small post-marketing epidemiology studies of mostly short-term, first-trimester exposure found that fluoroquinolones did not increase risk of major malformations, spontaneous abortions, premature birth, or low birth weight. The label notes, however, that these studies are insufficient to reliably evaluate the definitive safety or risk of less common defects by ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses. 2) Breastfeeding: Fluoroquinolones have been reported as present in a mother's milk and thus passed on to the nursing child. The U.S. FDA recommends that because of the risk of serious adverse reactions (including articular damage) in infants nursing from mothers taking ciprofloxacin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 3) Children: Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system: Inhalational anthrax (postexposure); Complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli,[35] but never as first-line agents. Current recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics note the systemic use of ciprofloxacin in children should be restricted to infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens or when no safe or effective alternatives are available.",
31e33206-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Clarithromycin,unrestricted,"Side effects: The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting (6%). It also can cause headaches, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests. Allergic reactions include rashes and anaphylaxis. Less common side effects (<1%) include extreme irritability, hallucinations (auditory and visual), dizziness/motion sickness, and alteration in senses of smell and taste, including a metallic taste. Dry mouth, panic attacks, and nightmares have also been reported, albeit less frequently. 1) Cardiac: Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged QT interval. In patients with long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins. Some case reports suspect it of causing liver disease. 2) Liver and kidney: Clarithromycin has been known to cause jaundice, cirrhosis, and kidney problems, including renal failure. 3) Central nervous system: Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches. Rarely, it can cause ototoxicity, delirium and mania. 4) Infection: A risk of oral candidiasis, due to the elimination of the yeast's natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, is also incurred. 5) Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk.",

It may be useful in treating gastroparesis due to this promotility effect. Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in endoscopy as an adjunct to clear gastric contents. More serious side effects include arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. Cholestasis, Stevens每Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis are some other rare side effects that may occur. Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) has been linked to an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants.[17][18] Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares and night sweats. It may also alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora.

The original formulation used sodium deoxycholate to improve solubility. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD) is administered IV, though with frequent adverse effects as detailed in the side effects section. As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as ""conventional"" amphotericin. 2) Liposomal formulations: In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed. From studies, it appears that liposomal amphotericin B preparations exhibit fewer side effects, while having similar efficacy. Various preparations have recently been introduced. All of these are more expensive than plain amphotericin B. AmBisome (LAMB) is a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for injection, developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead Sciences in 1999). It was approved by the FDA in 1997. It is marketed by Gilead in Europe and licensed to Astellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) for marketing in the USA, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in Japan. It consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol that in aqueous media they spontaneously arrange into unilamellar vesicles that contain amphotericin B. Liposomal formulations have been primarily used as it has been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate. Guidelines also recommend the use of LAMB for CNS fungal infections due to better pharmacokinetics and CNS penetration but do note that this is based only on animal models. Fungisome is a generic liposomal complex of amphotericin B. It is marketed by Lifecare Innovations of India. 3) Lipid complex formulations: Amphotec (ABCD) and Abelcet (ABLC) are lipid complex preparations. Abelcet was approved by the FDA in 1995. It consists of amphotericin B and two lipids in a 1:1 ratio that form large ribbon-like structures. Amphotec is a complex of amphotericin and sodium cholesteryl sulfate in a 1:1 ratio. Two molecules of each form a tetramer that aggregate into spiral arms on a disk-like complex. It was approved by the FDA in 1996. Neither of these are true unilamellar liposomes like ambisome. Oral preparations: A major barrier to the use of amphotericin in resource-poor settings is that it must be given intravenously (except for topical applications). An oral preparation exists, but is not commercially available. The amphipathic nature of amphotericin along with its low solubility and permeability has posed major hurdles for oral administration given its low bioavailability. In the past it had been used for fungal infections of the surface of the GI tract such as thrush, but has been replaced by other antifungals such as nystatin and fluconazole. However, recently novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems such as AmbiOnp, nanosuspensions, lipid-based drug delivery systems including cochleates, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles〞such as Amphotericin B in pegylated polylactide coglycolide copolymer nanoparticles〞have demonstrated potential for oral formulation of amphotericin B",

Topical preparations used in Europe often contain fusidic acid and gentamicin in combination, which helps to prevent the development of resistance. Depending on the reason for which sodium fusidate is prescribed, the adult dose can be 250 mg twice a day and or up to 750 mg three times a day. (Skin conditions normally need the smaller dose).

In both the popular press and the scientific literature, linezolid has been called a ""reserve antibiotic""〞one that should be used sparingly so that it will remain effective as a drug of last resort against potentially intractable infections. In the United States, the indications for linezolid use approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus. The manufacturer advises against the use of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA.

31e48fdf-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Liposomal amphotericin B,restricted,"Intravenous: 1) Deoxycholate: Amphotericin B alone is insoluble in normal saline at a pH of 7. The original formulation used sodium deoxycholate to improve solubility. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD) is administered IV, though with frequent adverse effects as detailed in the side effects section. As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as ""conventional"" amphotericin. 2) Liposomal formulations: In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed. From studies, it appears that liposomal amphotericin B preparations exhibit fewer side effects, while having similar efficacy. Various preparations have recently been introduced. All of these are more expensive than plain amphotericin B. AmBisome (LAMB) is a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for injection, developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead Sciences in 1999). It was approved by the FDA in 1997. It is marketed by Gilead in Europe and licensed to Astellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) for marketing in the USA, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in Japan. It consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol that in aqueous media they spontaneously arrange into unilamellar vesicles that contain amphotericin B. Liposomal formulations have been primarily used as it has been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate. Guidelines also recommend the use of LAMB for CNS fungal infections due to better pharmacokinetics and CNS penetration but do note that this is based only on animal models. Fungisome is a generic liposomal complex of amphotericin B. It is marketed by Lifecare Innovations of India. 3) Lipid complex formulations: Amphotec (ABCD) and Abelcet (ABLC) are lipid complex preparations. Abelcet was approved by the FDA in 1995. It consists of amphotericin B and two lipids in a 1:1 ratio that form large ribbon-like structures. Amphotec is a complex of amphotericin and sodium cholesteryl sulfate in a 1:1 ratio. Two molecules of each form a tetramer that aggregate into spiral arms on a disk-like complex. It was approved by the FDA in 1996. Neither of these are true unilamellar liposomes like ambisome. Oral preparations: A major barrier to the use of amphotericin in resource-poor settings is that it must be given intravenously (except for topical applications). An oral preparation exists, but is not commercially available. The amphipathic nature of amphotericin along with its low solubility and permeability has posed major hurdles for oral administration given its low bioavailability. In the past it had been used for fungal infections of the surface of the GI tract such as thrush, but has been replaced by other antifungals such as nystatin and fluconazole. However, recently novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems such as AmbiOnp, nanosuspensions, lipid-based drug delivery systems including cochleates, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles〞such as Amphotericin B in pegylated polylactide coglycolide copolymer nanoparticles〞have demonstrated potential for oral formulation of amphotericin B",

It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, a metallic taste, loss of appetite, and headaches. Occasionally seizures or allergies to the medication may occur. Metronidazole should not be used in early pregnancy but appears to be safe later in pregnancy. It should not be used when breastfeeding. Metronidazole began to be commercially used in 1960 in France. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is available in most areas of the world. The pills are not very expensive being between 0.01 and 0.10 USD each. In the United States it is about 26 USD for ten days of treatment. Common adverse drug reactions (≡1% of those treated with the drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole are associated with the development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies. Metronidazole may cause mood swings.

Both of these closely related antibiotics have similar levels of efficacy, although doxycycline has a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Historically, minocycline has been a very effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a significant number of acne patients no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline) because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily Propionibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as MRSA as well as Lyme disease, as the one pill twice daily 100 mg dosage is far easier for patients than the four times a day required with tetracycline or oxytetracycline. Its activity against Lyme disease is enhanced by its superior ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use as a prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo). It may be used to treat certain strains of MRSA infection and a disease caused by drug resistant acinetobacter. Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. Minocycline as well as doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. It is recognized as a DMARDS (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug) by the American College of Rheumatology, which recommends its use as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. A list of indications for which minocycline has been used include: Amoebic dysentery, Anthrax, Bubonic plague, Cholera, Ehrlichiosis, Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given), Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis), Hidradenitis suppurativa, HIV〞for use as an adjuvant to HAART, Periodontal disease, Perioral dermatitis, Respiratory infections such as pneumonia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rosacea, Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given), Urinary tract infections, rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes.",

Several trials comparing nitrofurantoin to other commonly used agents have shown this drug results in similar cure rates for uncomplicated UTIs. The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating UTIs combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the first-line agents for treating uncomplicated UTIs as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. Though the fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever, it should be noted here that norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials). In ophthalmology, Norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

It is a penicillin that is orally active. It is less active than benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) against Gram-negative bacteria. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is more acid-stable than benzylpenicillin, which allows it to be given orally. It exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-sensitive microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts by inhibiting the biosynthesis of cell-wall peptidoglycan. It is not active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which include many strains of Staphylococci. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has a range of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria that is similar to that of benzylpenicillin and a similar mode of action, but it is substantially less active than benzylpenicillin against Gram-negative bacteria. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is usually used only for the treatment of mild to moderate infections, and not for severe or deep-seated infections since absorption can be unpredictable. Except for the treatment or prevention of infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (which is uniformly sensitive to penicillin), therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response. Patients treated initially with parenteral benzylpenicillin may continue oral treatment with phenoxymethylpenicillin once a satisfactory clinical response has been obtained. For prophylaxis against rheumatic fever, phenoxymethylpenicillin given by mouth twice a day is used as an alternative to injections of benzathine penicillin given every two weeks.

For the treatment of tuberculosis, it is administered daily for at least 6 months. Combination therapy is utilized both to prevent the development of resistance and to shorten the length of treatment. Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin develops quickly when it is used without another antibiotic, with laboratory estimates of resistance rates from 10?7 to 10?10 per tuberculosis bacteria per generation. Rifampicin can be used alone in patients with latent tuberculosis infections to prevent the development of active disease because only small numbers of bacteria are present. A Cochrane review found no difference in efficacy between a three to four month regimen of rifampicin and a six-month regimen of isoniazid for preventing active tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV, and patients who received rifampicin had a lower rate of hepatotoxicity. However, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. A shorter two-month course of rifampicin and pyrazinamide had previously been recommended, but is no longer due to high rates of hepatotoxicity. Rifampicin should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water. It is generally taken either at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals. Rifampicin is also used to treat non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections including leprosy (Hansen's disease) and Mycobacterium kansasii.

The updated recommendations in this policy statement reflect new information regarding the seasonality of RSV circulation, palivizumab pharmacokinetics, the changing incidence of bronchiolitis hospitalizations, the effect of gestational age and other risk factors on RSV hospitalization rates, the mortality of children hospitalized with RSV infection, the effect of prophylaxis on wheezing, and palivizumab-resistant RSV isolates. This policy statement updates and replaces the recommendations found in the 2012 Red Book. Infants younger than one year with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (i.e. who were born at <32 weeks gestation and required supplemental oxygen for the first 28 days after birth) and infants younger than two years with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who required medical therapy (e.g. supplemental oxygen, glucocorticoids, diuretics) within six months of the anticipated RSV season are recommended to use palivizumab as prophylaxis. Also, infants younger than one year who were born at <29 weeks (i.e. ≒28 weeks, 6 days) of gestation are recommended to use palivizumab.",

It has activity against Gram-negative organisms and some strains of multi-resistant Pseudomonas spp. It does NOT have activity against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. It also has in vitro activity against some streptococci and some Gram-negative anaerobes, but it does not have reliable Staphylococcus spp. activity. Acceptable uses (Cases must be discussed with Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Stewardship Program): 1) Management of infections due to multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas spp. infections on a case by case basis. Unacceptable uses: 1) Empiric treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (clAI) or complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) as current standard regimens are sufficient for coverage of the typical pathogens involved in these infections and less expensive options are available. Dose: 1) 1.5glV Q8H has been studied for cUTI and in combination with metronidazole for cIAI. 2) Serious infections including pneumonia: 3glV Q8H. 3) Must adjust dose for worsening renal function and dialysis (see p.155 for dose adjustment recommendation).",

It is a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Teicoplanin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name Targocid. Other trade names include Ticosin marketed by Cipla(India). Oral teicoplanin has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy with vancomycin. Its strength is considered to be due to the length of the hydrocarbon chain.",

31e628b0-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Tobramycin,unrestricted,"Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is ototoxic: it can cause hearing loss, or a loss of equilibrioception, or both in genetically susceptible individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to affect cochlear cells. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible. As with all amino glycosides, tobramycin is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys. This effect can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing tubular reabsorption during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons parenteral tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by body weight, and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow therapeutic index.",
31e63578-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Trimethoprim,unrestricted,"It is primarily used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, although it may be used against any susceptible aerobic bacterial species. It may also be used to treat and prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. It is generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections such as Clostridium difficile colitis (the leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea). Trimethoprim has been used in trials to treat retinitis. Resistance to trimethoprim is increasing, but it is still a first line antibiotic in many countries.",
31e642fa-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Trimethoprim/Smx,unrestricted,"Pregnancy and breast feeding: Its use during pregnancy is contraindicated, although it has been placed in Australian and American pregnancy category C. Despite this, its use during the first trimester (during organogenesis) and 12 weeks prior to pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially malformations associated with maternal folic acid deficiency (which is most likely related to the mechanism of action of co-trimoxazole) such as neural tube defects such as spina bifida, cardiovascular malformations (e.g. Ebstein's anomaly), urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot in epidemiological studies. Its use later on during pregnancy also increases the risk of preterm labour (odds ratio: 1.51) and low birth weight (odds ratio: 1.67). Animal studies have yielded similarly discouraging results. It is also excreted in breast milk and hence nursing during treatment with co-trimoxazole is generally advised against.",
31e65185-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Unasyn,unrestricted,"The recommended adult dose of ampicillin/sulbactam is 1.5 grams (1g ampicillin sodium plus 0.5g sulbactam sodium) to 3.0 grams (2g ampicillin sodium plus 1g sulbactam sodium) every six hours. In pediatric patients, the dose is based on body weight and is recommended at 300 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. This total daily dose is to be divided into equal amounts to be given every six hours. In patients with decreased kidney function, the dosing frequency may need to be reduced.",
31e65f20-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Vancomycin,restricted,"Intravenous vs oral administration: Vancomycin must be given intravenously (IV) for systemic therapy, since it is not absorbed from the intestine. It is a large hydrophilic molecule that partitions poorly across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to short half-life, it is often injected twice daily. The only approved indication for oral vancomycin therapy is in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis, where it must be given orally to reach the site of infection in the colon. Following oral administration, the fecal concentration of vancomycin is around 500 ?g/ml (sensitive strains of C. difficile have a mean inhibitory concentration of ≒2 ?g/ml). Inhaled vancomycin has also been used (off-label), via nebulizer, for treatment of various infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract. The caustic nature of vancomycin makes IV therapy using peripheral lines a risk for thrombophlebitis. Ideally, central lines or infusion ports should be used.",
31e66f88-d685-11e6-82b5-3497f68b8eda,Voriconazole,restricted,"A study compared Voriconazole use to that of amphotericin B in the treatment of patients with unresolved fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy who are at risk for breakthrough fungal infections. While overall success rates were 26% for voriconazole and 30.6% for liposomal amphotericin B, there were significantly fewer breakthrough infections with voriconazole, particularly in the patients at highest risk. This study found similar fewer severe reactions and nephrotoxicity but more transient visual disturbances and hallucinations. Voriconazole was also associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization. The authors of this study concluded, ""This study demonstrates that voriconazole, a second-generation triazole, is an appropriate agent for empirical antifungal therapy and that its use may reduce the frequency of proven breakthrough fungal infections, preserve renal function, and reduce the frequency of acute infusion-related toxic effects. Formulations of amphotericin B have been the standard of empirical antifungal therapy for nearly 20 years. As this study shows, a second-generation triazole can be used in lieu of amphotericin B for early anti fungal therapy.",
